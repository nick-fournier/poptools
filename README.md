# poptools
A population synthesis toolbox for transportists, planners, demographers, and nerds.

This is still a work in progress, but have made available a working mock-up of a population generation in the Greater Boston Area. It should be transferrable to anywhere else in the US since the fundamental input data are from the US Census. However, some modification for Boston's TAZ boundaries were custom. This is located in "R/GBAexample" folder.
